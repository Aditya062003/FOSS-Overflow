# Introduction

To summarize my project in a nutshell, upload group photographs, categorize them by faces using ML, and easily share them. ðŸ¤³ðŸ¤–

This year in [Foss Overflow 2021](https://fossoverflow.dev/), I have worked on [Photo Sharing App](https://github.com/OpenLake/Photo-Sharing-App) project. It is Photo Sharing Web tool that allows us to obtain group photos that include us without having to keep or sort through all of the photos, saving us time and storage space. When a photo is uploaded, the app identifies the faces in it and arranges them according to the users who have been identified. This manner, group photographs may be shared so that you, as a user, can see images that you are a part of without having to do anything.

## How was my experience with FOSSOverflow'21?

My project got off to a rocky start, and it wasn't until I discussed my concerns with my mentor that I discovered an efficient and improved approach of developing software. My mentor's crucial advise is still fresh in my mind. According to him, project development is made up of 80% planning and 20% coding. My mentor exposed me to many new topics, and it was fun to explore project completion ideas. I'm thrilled I was able to contribute to a solution to a real-world problem. Thank you for assisting me through the development process and beyond, [Kumar Shivendu](https://github.com/KShivendu).âœŒðŸ˜Ž

## Achievements during FOSSOverflow'21
Some of my achievements during the project:

1. Developing a basic UI for users
2. Allowing users of a single room to upload their photos
3. Implementing OpenCV's face regognition library to encode faces
4. Using DBSCAN to cluster faces together
5. Finally, showing face albums in order of their simmilarities to each other

and much more...
